Data wrangling is also a process of cleaning and the complex data sets are combined for easy analysis and access.
With the amount of data and data sources quickly expanding and growing. It is getting more and more essential for the large amounts of available data to well organize for clear study (analysis) and future operations.
This process includes manually converting and mapping data from one raw form into another format for more convenience and easy consumption and organization of the data.
The goals of data wrangling:
Reveal a “deeper intelligence” within given data, by gathering data from multiple sources
Provide actionable, accurate data in the hands of business analysts in a timely matter
Reduce the time spent in organizing and collecting unruly data before it can be utilized
Enable analysts and data scientists to focus on the analysis of data, rather than the wrangling
